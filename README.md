1. Open your browserâ€™s extension/add-ons manager.

Google Chrome:

Click on the three vertical dots (menu icon) in the top-right corner of the browser window.
Hover over "Extensions".
Click on "Manage Extensions".
Alternatively, type chrome://extensions in the address bar and press Enter.

2. Review all installed extensions carefully.
3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension.


Familiarity: Do you recognize this extension? Do you remember installing it?
Purpose: What is its stated purpose? Is it something you actively use?
Permissions: Click on the "Details" (Chrome/Edge) or the extension name (Firefox) to see its permissions. Permissions are crucial!
Examples of concerning permissions: "Read and change all your data on all websites," "Access your physical location," "Read your Browse history," "Read and change your data on websites you visit." While some legitimate extensions (like ad blockers or password managers) need broad permissions, be wary if an unfamiliar extension requests them.
Reviews/Ratings: Look for the user reviews and overall rating. Low ratings, numerous negative reviews mentioning privacy issues, or sudden drops in ratings are red flags.
Last Updated: When was it last updated? Extensions that haven't been updated in a long time might have security vulnerabilities or might be abandoned.
Publisher: Who is the developer? Is it a reputable company, or a generic, suspicious-sounding name?
4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions.

Based on your review, categorize extensions as:

Necessary/Trusted: Extensions you actively use and trust (e.g., your password manager, a well-known ad blocker, a legitimate productivity tool).
Unused/Redundant: Extensions you installed but no longer use, or extensions whose functionality is now built into the browser or covered by another extension.
Suspicious/Unknown: Extensions you don't remember installing, that have overly broad permissions for their stated purpose, have poor reviews, or come from unknown developers.
5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions.

For each extension you identified as suspicious or unnecessary:
Click the "Remove" button (Chrome/Edge) or the three dots next to the extension name and select "Remove" (Firefox).
Confirm the removal when prompted.
6. Restart browser and check for performance improvements.

After removing extensions, close all browser windows completely.
Re-open your browser.
Observe if there are any noticeable improvements in:
Browser startup speed.
Page loading times.
Overall responsiveness and smoothness.
Reduced CPU or memory usage (you can check this in your computer's Task Manager or Activity Monitor).
7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users.

Malicious browser extensions can pose significant threats to user privacy and security in various ways:

Data Theft: They can "read and change all your data on all websites," allowing them to steal login credentials, financial information (credit card numbers), personal messages, and Browse history. This data can then be sold or used for identity theft.
Adware/Malvertising: They can inject unwanted advertisements, pop-ups, or redirect your browser to malicious websites, disrupting your Browse experience and potentially leading to further malware infections.
Phishing: They can alter legitimate websites to display fake login forms or trick users into revealing sensitive information.
Hijacking Browser Settings: They can change your default search engine, homepage, or redirect your web traffic, making it difficult to browse as intended and potentially routing you through malicious proxies.
Tracking and Surveillance: They can track your online activities, collect data about your habits, and build comprehensive profiles for targeted advertising or other malicious purposes, even if that wasn't their initial intent (e.g., legitimate extensions sold to malicious actors).
Botnet Participation: In extreme cases, they can turn your browser into part of a botnet, using your computer's resources for malicious activities like DDoS attacks or cryptocurrency mining without your knowledge.
Malware Delivery: They can serve as a delivery mechanism for other types of malware, downloading and installing additional harmful software onto your system.
8. Document steps taken and extensions removed.
